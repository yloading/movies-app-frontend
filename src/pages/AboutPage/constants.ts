    content: `- Frontend: Built with React, and Tailwind as the styling library, the user interface is designed to be user-friendly, making it easy for you to view their ratings and details.
               \n- Backend: Backend is powered by Express and Node.js, handling data processing and server-side logic efficiently.
               \n- TypeScript: Used TypeScript in both Frontend and Backend to ensure that our code is robust and maintainable, providing a better development experience and reducing the risk of errors.`,
