               \n- Backend: Our backend is powered by Express and Node.js, handling data processing and server-side logic efficiently.
               \n- TypeScript: We use TypeScript in both Frontend and Backend to ensure that our code is robust and maintainable, providing a better development experience and reducing the risk of errors.`,
